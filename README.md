## 🚀 About Me
I love building clean, practical, and privacy-friendly applications — from backend APIs to browser extensions that actually make life easier.  
I’m currently exploring how **AI** can enhance everyday productivity tools, and enjoy connecting strong backends with elegant frontends.

### 💬 Personal Note
I like creating tools that quietly make work easier — whether it’s writing an email faster or automating small workflows.  
Every project you see here started as something I wanted to use myself and grew from there.
